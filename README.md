#TabuWeb

  TabuWeb is website/web application that I developed in my "Web Technologies" class.It's mathematical game, for kids, that involves arithmetic operations. It is designed in an intuitive and appellative way, where the user gets points everytime it solves correctly an operation.
It had a Multiplayer 'version', but the server where it was hosted was only up for the duration of the semester, and was implemented in Perl with CGI. The code is not available here.
